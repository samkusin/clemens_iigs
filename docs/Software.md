## Apple II+, IIe, IIc

### Solid

### Boots

* Commando
* Sammy Lightfoot
* Stargate
* Take 1 (Baudville)
* Stickybear Town Builder

### Problematic

* Oregon Trail - hangs.  Likely there's something going on with 64K support.
* Rescue Raiders
  * Boots to title screen
  * Add some more soft-switch support
* Hard Hat Mack
  * Likely Requires Disk II card vs the IIgs internal ROM due to how BOOT0
    loads 16 sectors and seems to timeout at around sector #8 before the IIgs
    'check startup disk' message comes up
*
