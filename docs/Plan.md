# Clemens GS

## Summary

The Clemens GS emulator's goal is to *emulate* the Apple IIgs design (ROM3
with ROM1 if possible compatibility.)

## TODO

This is a running todo list.

* NMI support for Mockingboard right channel (or just use the IRQB)
* Add trace debugging when executing a specific address (PBR:PC)
* Support DSK and PO, 2IMG files
  * 2IMG serialization
  * Allow PO loading from the 2IMG system (for .po files)
* AY8910 emulation for Mockingboard
* Ensoniq 5503 emulation
  * http://www.buchty.net/ensoniq/5503.html
* Dblhires is offset by 4 pixels (1 block) in display due to conversion method
* remaining //e softswitches
  * Joystick, Paddle
* Test Bards Tale and Ultima IV
  * How does A2 Speaker support sound
  * If bad (relatively speaking...) then look at the system beep task below
* Support Disk II Card for old boot
* Look at fast vs slow for iigs specific IO registers (FPI, CYA based)
* Timing checks on native mode versions of:
  * STA (DP), Y and likely other direct-indirect indexed ops are missing a
    IO cycle (likely just writes, but evaluate rules in wd65c816 docs...)
  * ADC, AND, CMP, EOR, LDA, ORA, SBC, STA
* Check if system beep is supposed to call Ensoniq DOC
  * Assuming that the system thunks down to speaker beeps (which may be the
    reason for the tinny beep sound
  * If not, then need to 'curve' out the square wave generated by speaker clicks
* CLEM_MMIO_REG_VGC_IRQ_BYTE
* Some Apple II games testing
* C041 INTEN - enable Mega II, VBL, quartersec interrupts
* C047 clearing timer interrupt flags for VBL and quartersec
* ADB Mouse Support and Data Interrupts
* C046 phase 2 - Mouse
* Flashing characters
* Test ROM 1
* C039 Register (Serial Communications Command register )
* Data accesses across banks are allowed (but not stack accesses?)
* Audit Direct Page in emulation mode (wrap zero page, only if D=0000 for 6502
  instructions, but for 65816 instructions there is no wrapping?)
* Emulation vs Native on some microinstructions (i.e. choosing a long address mode while in emulation does... what?)
* Ghosting banks?
* VGC Pass 4: SHGR
* Ensoniq!
* IIgs diagnostic test pass or fail?
* ADB Mouse on Keypad Feature
* Support Monochrome text, lores, hires, dbl-hires, super hires
* clipboard (paste)


## DONE

* Enable custom logic for card slot reads/writes since different cards map
  registers to their dedicated page instead of at $c0xx
* Remove ClemensDrive dependencies on WOZ and 2IMG (ClemensNibbleDisk)
  * Serializer changes with new ClemensNibbleDisk and has_disk field for
    ClemensDrive
* IWM 3.5" write support
* Scan boot to slot 5 may not work vs direct boot to 5
* GUI improvements
* ProDOS 16 boot
* IWM 3.5" read support
* Fixed machine power cycle and 3.5" disks not being persisted
* ProDOS boot (1.x or ProDOS 8)
  * Fixed IWM drive enable after a delayed disable
* Fixed memory mapping bug for page 0x3 in main/aux banks (RAMRD)
* VGC Pass 3 : Dblhires Graphics (not SHGR)
  * Convert bit string for a scanline into colors
  * 4-bits per color, 7 bits per byte of data from bit 0 to 6 (7 ignored)
  * Alternate between aux and main (just like 80 column text)
  * Same scanlines as the hires mode
  * Use original IIgs conversion from composite to RGB
  * Test one double-hires title
* Support Disk switching in the IDE
* Capslock
* Save Battery RAM
* AN3 and Dblhires
* Load State
* fix audio restart
* Save state
* Some Simple Apple II games testing
  * Oregon Trail Plays
  * Sammy Lightfoot Plays
  * Ultima I plays (two disks)
* Fixed c08x write protect switches (and now Oregon Trail plays!)
* Fixed BRK and Decimal mode according to test failures
* Run 6502 test suite from Klaus
* Fixed c08x write enable switches
* Fixed boot on write-protect disabled (enbl2 minimal support)
* Commando gets to the QuickDOS loading screen but spins indefinitely at
  Track 34 after that
* Sammy Lightfoot starts
* Diagnosed Hard Hat Mack WOZ issue - likely it's the IIgs internal boot rom
  for slot 6 (ROM 03, maybe 1)
  * The 16 sector read from track 0 on boot is too long and the internal rom
    will timeout and invoke the Check Startup Disk error
  * At some point support Disk II card selection since there's no timeout there
* Fixed STA (dp), y timing bug (likely there are others...)
* Audio Phase I (just get the system beeps working, speaker clicks too)
* DOS newly formatted disk via INIT working (haven't tried booting yet..., but
  catalog, save/load, work...)
* Many simple instructions we're clocked at 1 cycle (incorrect - 2 cycles!)
  * INY/DEY, INX,DEX, TXA, etc.
* Timing Issues - fix clem_cycle bug!
  * STA a,X  4(5)
  * PLA, PLX, etc 3(4)
  * RTS 5(6)
* First 5.25" disk boot (DOS 3.3)
* Fixed stepper motor logic for 5.25" drive
* Fixed timing issues when disk motor turns on (slow mode)
* Fix timing per IWM frame so that we dont persist lag, since LSS cycles should
  consume all CPU cycles per frame
* audio registers (interrupt) need implementation
* Serial register read/write simple
* Fix various unimplemented stuff
* Get Control Panel Working
* RTC clock time (read)
* VGC Pass 2 : Lores Graphics (not SHGR)

* Fixed bad TYA instruction for 16-bit A <- 8-bit Y register
  * a 2 day headache to debug a monitor memory set issue
  * ended up affecting boot time (faster now)
  * This could've been caught by tests...
* 80 column text (PR#3)
* look at typing to see if there are bugs and fix them at the basic prompt
* test cold reset
* Investigate crash - currently looking at SetWAPT during reset
  * Look at fe/079f (this method is where we call SetWAPT again for toolset 0x16)
* Display video
* VGC Pass 0.1 - Find apple ii fonts to use
* VGC Pass 0.2 - define API to access the text page
* VGC pass 1 : text modes and switches

## Video Controller (VDC)

The host program is responsible for rendering video.  At a certain frequency
the host polls for video data.   The host will have buffer-like access to the
mega2 banks (e0, e1):
  40 column page (main)
  80 column page (aux)
  hires pages(0,1)
  Double hires pages(0,1)
  Super hires pages
