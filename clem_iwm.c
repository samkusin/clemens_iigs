 /*
    Emulation of disk drives and the IWM Controller.

    Each floppy drive head is driven by a 4 phase stepper motor.  Drive
    emulation tracks:

    * Spindle motor status On|Off
    * Spindle Motor spin-up, full-speed and spindown times
    * Stepper motor cog_index and phase magnets
    * Head position (i.e. track, half)
    * Read and Write Positions on the current track

    For 5.25 drives, this is trivial relative to 3.5" drives, which employed
    a variable speed motor to increase storage capability of the outer rings
    (which have more surface area compared with the inside rings.)
